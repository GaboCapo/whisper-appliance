## [0.6.0] - 2025-06-29

### üîÑ **MAJOR STRATEGY CHANGE**

#### **NEW APPROACH: Proxmox Container First**
- **Priority Shift**: Focus on Proxmox LXC Container deployment instead of ISO builds
- **Reason**: Fedora livemedia-creator proved unreliable with 15+ hour build times and library conflicts
- **Target**: Debian-based ISO builds planned for future (more stable than Fedora Rawhide)

### Added
- ‚úÖ **Proxmox One-Liner Deployment** - Complete installation with single command
- ‚úÖ **Container-First Architecture** - LXC container deployment strategy
- ‚úÖ **Automated Setup Scripts** - `install-container.sh` and `proxmox-standalone.sh`
- ‚úÖ **Web-based Update Management** - Update system with safety features and rollback
- ‚úÖ **Health Check Endpoints** - `/health` API for monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions with quality checks
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Architecture, deployment, and troubleshooting guides
- ‚úÖ **Security Configuration** - Firewall setup and user isolation

### Changed
- **Deployment Strategy**: Container-first approach instead of ISO builds
- **Target OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instead of Fedora Rawhide
- **Installation Time**: Reduced from 15+ hours to 10-15 minutes

### Fixed
- ShellCheck SC1078 error in proxmox-standalone.sh (unclosed quote in Jinja2 template)
- Permission issues in LXC container script execution
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline failures

### Security
- Added security policy and vulnerability reporting process
- Implemented secure deployment practices
- Added code audit recommendations for production use

## [0.5.0] - 2025-06-27

### Attempted
- **Fedora ISO Build System**: Extensive work on livemedia-creator
- **Mock Build Environment**: Complex dependency management

### Issues Found
- Library conflicts between packages
- 15+ hour build times with frequent hangs
- Mock environment instability
- `auth` vs `authselect` kickstart syntax changes

### Deprecated
- Fedora-based ISO build approach (moved to container-first strategy)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Initial WhisperS2T integration
- Docker development environment
- Basic web interface implementation
- File upload functionality

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Project structure establishment
- Multi-platform build system design
- Development tooling (`dev.sh`)
- Initial documentation structure

---

## Technical Notes

### **Fedora ISO Build Issues Encountered**
- `auth` vs `authselect` kickstart syntax changes
- Missing `dracut-live` packages
- `livmedia-creator` "results_dir should not exist" errors  
- PulseAudio vs PipeWire conflicts
- Missing libblockdev libraries in Mock environment
- 15+ hour build times with frequent hangs

### **Container Advantages**
- Standard Linux distribution base (Debian/Ubuntu)
- Package manager reliability
- Faster iteration cycles
- Standard deployment workflows
- Better debugging capabilities
